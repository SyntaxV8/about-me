<h5 class="margin Headers">A funny story about me:</h5>
<p>When I was in highschool we were on a field trip to Italy. Venice to be exact. Because we were all rebellious teens, we decided to start drinking at night in our room.
<br>As you can probably imagine, we weren't exactly quiet. As we were talking and having fun, I heard a loud knocking on our door.
<br>I went to the door to open it up (It was locked) while I heard our teacher yelling to open up. In a drunkely manner I told him to wait a bit. He couldn't.
<br>So he kicked our door in! As we were all trying to grasp reality, we all realised he was drunk too. So we kinda blackmailed him into keeping this drunk little accident a secret for both parties involved.  </p>

<h6 class="margin">TL;DR</h6>
<p>Teacher kicked our door in on a field trip, he was drunk, we too, so we kept it a secret.</p>
